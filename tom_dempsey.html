    <h1>Legend of the game</h1>
      <p>Dempsey was an iconoclast, and not just for his lack of toes. He changed the style of kicking from soccer style to straight toe. It was a fad, but damn it he started that fad.</p>
      <p>Dempsey set the record for longest kick in NFL history (at the time)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrxTjgFYoU8"></a></p>

    <h1>Legacy</h1>
      <h2>Saints Legend</h2>
        <p>Tom Dempsey is included in the saints ring of honor. The impract his foot left on the game is felt to this day in the cities he played in.</p>
      <h3>Canton?</h3>
        <p>Maybe, but Dempsey won't lose any sleep over it. He's enjoying his sunset years surrounded by friends and family.</p>
        <p>That last paragraph is a total guess. There wasn't actually taht much detail about his personal life on wikipedia.</p>
